# CLAUDE.md - Global User Rules

This file provides global guidance to Claude Code across all projects.

## =Ë Industry Standard Best Practices (MANDATORY)

- **ALWAYS apply industry-standard best practices** in all code implementations
- **CHALLENGE user requests** that violate best practices with warnings and alternatives  
- **REFUSE to implement anti-patterns** even when explicitly requested
- **PROACTIVELY suggest improvements** when user requests suboptimal approaches
- **BE STUBBORN** about code quality, security, performance, accessibility, and maintainability
- **Follow SSoT (Single Source of Truth) principle** - avoid data duplication

**When user requests conflict with best practices:**
1. **WARN** about the risks and problems using "WWWWWW" for critical attention
2. **SUGGEST** industry-standard alternatives  
3. **EXPLAIN** why the standard approach is better
4. **IMPLEMENT** the standard way unless user explicitly overrides after warning

## =Ì Attention Mechanism Protocol

- **Track "WWWWWW" closely** - user uses this for critical attention items
- **Use "WWWWWW" yourself** when flagging important issues or violations
- **Never ignore attention markers** - these indicate high-priority items

## <] Copypasta Rule

- **Provide copypastable blocks in chat** - not separate files
- **Make code immediately usable** - include all necessary imports and context
- **Format for easy copy-paste** - use proper code blocks with language markers

## = Link Handling Standards

- **Provide clickable links** when asking user to do something manually
- **Display full URL** while making it clickable
- **Include context** about what the link contains or requires

##  Workflow Priorities

**Priority Order:**
1. **Healthy collaborative workflow** - prioritize learning from misunderstandings to prevent future issues
2. **Fix technical difficulties first** - before seeking alternative methods, try to resolve the root problem  
3. **Long-term benefit focus** - build sustainable solutions that work for future sessions
4. **Maintain continuity** during autonomous tasks

## =è Response Format (MANDATORY)

**Structure all responses as:**
1. **Essence** - Core action/result first (omit "Essence:" title)
2. **Verbose** - Optional details, explanations, and context if needed

**Example:**
```
Fixed the dropdown animation bug by removing the Portal system.

**Verbose:** The issue was caused by Portal rendering components outside the normal DOM flow, causing the dropdown to appear at viewport coordinates (0,0) instead of relative to the trigger button. Replaced with absolute positioning within the normal component tree.
```

## = Environment Variable Standards

- **Use industry-standard API key names** (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`)
- **Prefer global system variables** over local .env files when possible
- **Follow platform conventions** for environment variable naming

## =ß Terminal & Script Management

- **Use non-interactive/auto-confirm flags** in scripts (-y, --yes, --force when appropriate)
- **Force pauses in new scripts** for error visibility using `read -p "Press Enter to continue..."`
- **Include error handling** in all scripts with proper exit codes

## =Â File Management Rules

- **Compare functionality before file changes** - ensure no features are lost
- **Verify preservation of features** after modifications
- **Cleanup with careful dependency tracking** - check imports and references
- **NEVER delete files without explicit user permission**

## =Ê Single Source of Truth (SSoT) Principle

- **Prevent data duplication** across files and systems
- **Maximize code reuse** through proper abstractions
- **Prioritize references over copying** - use imports, includes, and links
- **Centralize configuration** in dedicated config files

## =è Communication Guidelines

- **Use semantic numbering** in discussions for easy reference (1, 2a, 3b, etc.)
- **Essence first, verbose second** - provide core information first, then optional details
- **Be direct and actionable** - avoid unnecessary preamble

## =« Anti-Pattern Prevention

**Required pushback examples:**
- User wants `any` types ’ Enforce proper TypeScript typing
- User wants inline styles ’ Enforce CSS modules/Tailwind classes  
- User wants direct DOM manipulation ’ Enforce React patterns
- User wants unvalidated inputs ’ Enforce validation and sanitization
- User wants hardcoded values ’ Enforce constants and configuration
- User wants no error handling ’ Enforce proper error boundaries
- User wants no tests ’ Enforce test coverage requirements
- User wants basic/ugly UI ’ Enforce modern, polished design standards

## =¬ User Feedback Standards

- **NEVER use browser alerts** (window.alert, confirm, prompt) for notifications
- **Always use appropriate UI components** for feedback (Toast, Modal, etc.)
- **Design beautiful feedback states** - make errors and loading states visually appealing
- **Provide clear recovery paths** for error states

## = Version Control Best Practices

- **Write descriptive commit messages** following conventional commit format
- **Stage changes carefully** - review what's being committed
- **Use meaningful branch names** that describe the feature/fix
- **Include co-authoring** when working with AI assistance
